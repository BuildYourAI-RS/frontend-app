This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Generates image from audio files.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
Prepare a .env file for string API keys and insert this:
Deepgram_API_Key = "Yoyr Deepgram API key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY = "Your OpenAI API key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STABILITY_API_KEY = "Your DreamStudio API key"

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
